The project’s purpose is to make official cybersecurity statistics easier to analyze, visualize, and integrate into research and decision-making. The original report is published as a PDF, which limits data reusability. This repository converts the most relevant statistics into a clean CSV dataset. Information is grouped by category and enriched with context notes to help analysts and policymakers quickly understand trends.
