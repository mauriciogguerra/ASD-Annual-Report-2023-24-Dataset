Questions and Answers for ASD 2023-24 Dataset Analysis

1) When did ASD incident activity peak during FY2023–24, and are there seasonal patterns?
Answer: Monthly incident counts show a peak in March 2024 (111 incidents), with elevated activity in Oct–Dec 2023 and Feb–Mar 2024. Summer (Dec) and late-winter/early-spring (Aug–Oct and Feb–Mar) show higher-than-average activity, suggesting periodic spikes possibly tied to end-of-year campaigns and post-holiday scanning. The lowest month in the dataset is January 2024 (70 incidents).

2) How do incident types and attack vectors differ for Critical Infrastructure (CI) compared to non-CI organisations?
Answer: CI incidents have a higher share of DoS/DDoS (11% for CI vs ~5% for non-CI) and are more likely to involve credential compromise (32% of CI incidents). Phishing (23%) and exploitation of public-facing applications (21%) are leading causes for CI incidents, whereas non-CI reports emphasis includes online banking fraud and BEC. This indicates CI targets suffer more availability-focused attacks and compromises of operational accounts.

3) What is the distribution of financial impact across business sizes, and which cybercrime type causes the largest total loss?
Answer: Average self-reported costs: Small businesses ≈ AUD 49,600 (+8% vs prior), Medium ≈ AUD 62,800 (−35%), Large ≈ AUD 63,600 (−11%). Although medium and large businesses report higher per-incident costs, Business Email Compromise (BEC) accounts for a very large total self-reported loss (≈ AUD 84 million), with average confirmed BEC incidents exceeding AUD 55,000. Thus BEC is the largest single aggregate financial drag in the dataset.
